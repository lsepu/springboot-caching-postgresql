= springboot-caching-postgresql

The goal of this project is to explore how caching works. For it, we are going to implement a simple https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/index.html[`Spring Boot`] application called `comic-api`. We are using PostgreSQL for storage and, for caching, we can pick one of the following providers: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/io/caching.html#io.caching.provider.simple[`Simple`] or https://redis.io/[`Redis`].
